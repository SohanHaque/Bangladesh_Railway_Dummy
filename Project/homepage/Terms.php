    <hr>
    <div>
        <p style="font-size: 22px;">E-tickets will be automatically issued by Bangladesh Railway Portal within 30 minutes of successful payment. User(s) can obtain their ticket(s) and also download the PDF version of the ticket from the confirmation page. Concurrently, a copy of the ticket will be sent to the user's email address. However, some mail service providers such as Gmail, Yahoo!, Outlook might place the email in “SPAM” folder. Furthermore, it might also be possible that the mail has been blocked by any of the mentioned service providers. However, email containing PDF tickets may be delayed for technical reasons. Therefore, unavailability of the confirmation mail should not be regarded as non-issuance of ticket. If the reservation does not materialize and the client-passenger still wants to try for the same reservation once again, the process will be treated as a new reservation. User(s) can always download the tickets from the “Purchase History” section of the website or “My Tickets” section of Rail Sheba app.</p>
        <h3 style="color: #DA924E;">Ticket purchase limitation per day:</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 22px;">Bangladesh Railway passengers:

Can purchase maximum 4 tickets (seats) in a single transaction. The transaction can be online or at the ticket booking counter at stations.
Can do maximum of 2 transactions per day.
    Maximum of 8 tickets can be purchased per day.
    Train numbers should be different for those two transactions.
    Origin stations should be different for those two transactions.
    Destination stations should be different for those two transactions.

To issue railway tickets, Bangladesh Railway Portal depends on different payment getaways for the Card/Wallet charge information. Bangladesh Railway does not store any sensitive information of Passengers such as Card/Wallet details, OTP, Pin Code. In case any Card/Wallet is charged and/or Payment Gateway fails to return the information in due time, it is possible that the passenger's Card/Wallet would be charged without being issued for the desired tickets. In such instances, Payment Gateways will automatically refund the purchased amount by the Client-Passenger to their respective Card/Wallet within 8 (eight) working days. However, in case such a Client-Passenger does not receive refund within 8 (eight) working days, the client Client-Passenger is requested to send a complaint email to support@eticket.railway.gov.bd with details of the issue. A reply to such a Client-Passenger will be sent within 7 working days. Due to the dependency on payment service providers, it might take several days to resolve the issue. For a refund of unsuccessful purchases and card charging issues, Client-Passenger must contact the Payment Service Provider through which s/he made the transaction. For a refund of successfully purchased tickets, the Client-Passenger must visit their respective originating station (i.e., Departure Station from which the Client-Passenger will travel) and contact the refund counter. Bangladesh Railway or Shohoz-Synesis-Vincen JV will not be held responsible for the non-issuance of tickets or delay of refund due to errors in payment processing or any other reasons that are beyond the control of Bangladesh Railway or Shohoz-Synesis-Vincen JV. Bangladesh Railway makes no guarantee/warranty that any of the above services will be uninterrupted, timely or error-free due to the dependencies on many Service Providers.</p>
